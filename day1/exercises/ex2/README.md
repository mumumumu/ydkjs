# Instructions

1. Define a "dictionary" list of words that can commonly be used in software/computer acronyms.

2. Write an acronym solver that takes a single string of one or more characters, and returns a list of possible solutions, where each solution is an array of the matching words from the acronym.

3. Bonus: write tests for your solver.
